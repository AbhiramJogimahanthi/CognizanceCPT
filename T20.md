## Problem Of The Day ( Raccoon City Rebuild )

Racoon City after being completely annihilated has to be rebuilt in a specific order of building heights keeping in mind the older situations because of the apocalypse. So the engineers want a design where the height of all the buildings is chosen by the residents. Then the engineers decide a center point and all the buildings are built around that center point in descending order based on the heights. Design a code to arrange all the heights given into an array with the max height at the specified index and all other elements surrounding it reducing in height. The 2nd highest building always comes to the right of the highest building.

Input Format

  The first line contains a single integer T containing the number of test cases. T lines follow
  The first line of each test case gives the size of the array of heights N and the index of the highest building i.
  The next line contains the unsorted array containing the heights H of all the residents
